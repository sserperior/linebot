# Linebot
This is a simple chatbot for the [LINE](https://line.me) app. For more information on how to implement LINE chatbots, see [here](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/building-bot/).

The chatbot is implemented in [NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org). You can host it on any Cloud provider. You will need to override the CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN and CHANNEL_SECRET environment variables with those from your LINE channel.
